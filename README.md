# NFL Team Record Prediction

This project utilizes a machine learning model to predict NFL team records for the next 5 years based on historical data. The model is built using a RandomForestClassifier and trained on data about team matchups, spread favorites, over/under lines, and team scores.

## Project Overview

This script performs the following tasks:
1. Loads and preprocesses data from CSV files.
2. Encodes team names into numeric values.
3. Trains a Random Forest classifier to predict game outcomes.
4. Simulates NFL seasons to predict team records for the next 5 years based on the trained model.
